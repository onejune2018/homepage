I am working as a senior algorithm researcher of Ping An deep learning Platform SFE team, leading the innovation team and doing some fundamental research. If interested, feel free to email me at [junwang.deeplearning@gmail.com](mailto:junwang.deeplearning@gmail.com).

I graduated with a Ph.D from Peking University in 2016. I worked as a research scientist at the IBM China Research Institute (2016-2018), and an assistant engineer at the Institute of Software, the Chinese Academy of Sciences (2011-2012), and a visiting scholar at ETH Zurich (2015). 

I have participated in national 863 scientific research projects in image recognition, smart city, etc., and is currently engaged in computational vision, AIDD research and development at PingAn. 

I have published 40+ papers in deep learning and other fields (including IJCAI, BMVC, NeuroComputing, Pattern Recognition, BIB, IEEE GRSL, WWW, Remote Sensing, etc.), as well as reviewers of multiple journals and conferences. 

I have successfully applied for 30+ patents, and won the National Scholarship, IBM Outstanding Technical Achievement Award, as well as being the MIT AI cure, VQA, EAD, TREC and other international Al competition winner.
