I work as a senior algorithm researcher of Ping An deep learning Platform SFE team, leading the innovation team and doing some fundamental research. If interested, feel free to email me at [junwang.deeplearning@gmail.com](mailto:junwang.deeplearning@gmail.com).

I graduated with a Ph.D. from Peking University in 2016. I worked as a research scientist at the IBM China Research Institute (2016-2018), an assistant engineer at the Software Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (2011-2012), and a visiting scholar at ETH Zurich (2015). I have participated in national 863 scientific research projects in the fields of remote sensing image intelligent cognition, smart city, etc., and is currently engaged in computational vision, AI drug research and development and platform construction in Ping An. 

I have published 10+ papers in deep learning and other fields as the first or corresponding author (including IJCAI, BMVC, NeuroComputing, Pattern Recognition, BIB, IEEE GRSL, WWW, Remote Sensing, etc.), as well as reviewers of multiple journals and conferences. I have successfully applied for more than 30 patents, and won the National Scholarship, IBM Outstanding Technical Achievement Award, as well as being the MIT AI cure, VQA, EAD, TREC and other international Al technology competition champions.
